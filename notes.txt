 the constructor() we are taking two parameters nlinks - number of links and
pointA - points of connection.
Using Composites.stack() function we create the multiple
rectangular bodies and store it in the rect variable. Using the Composites.chain() function we create the
chain of the rectangles.
And then using the Constraints.create() we add the constraints to the chain which connects all the bodies of the chain together like we have string in a necklace.
We have the break() function which helps us to break the chain.It simply makes the rope body null.
